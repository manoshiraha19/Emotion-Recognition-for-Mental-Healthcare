# Emotion-Recognition-for-Mental-Healthcare
Mental healthcare has become a prevailing need in the current state of society. 
To be able to receive proper guidance in this sector, although, still remains expensive for most. 
Thus, the need arises for an option that could provide base-level diagnosis. 
The purpose is to better understand the common gestures recognizable by a machine, that are made by humans, in order to realise what they feel.  
The program aims to categorically analyse different facial features and how they modify from person to person while they go through a range of emotions. 
The program focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to categorise expressions using computer vision to analyse 
reactions of a human being on a pre- recorded video. There are 7 common emotions included, them being: happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, surprise and neutrality. 
Such facial expression recognition programs, when made more complex, will have significant future applications in cybernetics by furthering 
a more human-like interaction between machines and humans. This could have extended applications for mental healthcare facilities by recognizing 
emotions indicating common symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety among people.
